comment: Custom items are included. "Field Notes- Upon my arrival on this mostly aquatic planet a sentient boat found me and said it wants to help me. I do not trust this 'boat' but I do not have any other choices for travel and I have found through my interactions on land only a minority of the local species are friendly while the rest are deeply hostile."
