Niko comes from OneShot, a very impactful game that I played during a sad time in my life several years ago. It has stuck with me ever since. I can't recommend it enough, it's an excellent experience.

This mod replaces the following items:
Bombs -> The Sun
Deku Leaf -> Alula's Feather
Hero's Charm -> Barrens' Gas Mask
Power Bracelets -> Golden Clovers

Thank You:

    xinus22: for the Niko model. It looks great! While I do think xinus's style is slightly too low-poly for Wind Waker, it's certainly better than anything I could ever hope to produce, and it fits for a translation of a pixelated character to a 3D environment.

    LagoLunatic, SageOfMirrors, and the other Wind Waker Rando devs who I'm unfamiliar with: for the modding toolchain and a really fun rando. Also Laenthor: for his supplemental model tutorial. Special mention to Lago, since he's consistently sharing his specialized knowledge or working to help people figure stuff out in the Discord.

    BigSharkZ: for outstanding Wind Waker cosmetic mods, the mute voice pack, advice, and words of encouragement.

    NightMargin, GIR, and Eliza: for OneShot.
